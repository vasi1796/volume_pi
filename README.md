# volume_pi
### Description
On the hardware side you have 5 leds with colors ranging from green to red. Another side of the hardware is an analog potentiometer that uses an RC circuit to send data to the Raspberry Pi and control the volume.
The software side of the project is a python script that has as input a song to be played and the potentiometer values. As the values get higher so does the volume and more leds light up.

### TODO
* make a web interface for song and volume control 
* use RGB led strip instead of single leds
